Control two servo motors in opposite directions using Arduino
# 🌟 Dual Servo Motion with Arduino
A simple Arduino project that controls two servo motors in opposite directions — one sweeps from 0° to 180°, while the other sweeps from 180° to 0°.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `dual_servo.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your servos to the Arduino as follows:
   - Servo 1 signal → Pin 9  
   - Servo 2 signal → Pin 10  
   - Both VCC → 5V  
   - Both GND → GND
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Power it up and watch the synchronized motion!

📌 **Expected behavior:**  
Servo 1 moves from 0° to 180°  
Servo 2 moves from 180° to 0°  
Both move smoothly in opposite directions.
